# heart-disease-prediction-ml
A machine learning project to predict heart disease using Python and Scikit-Learn.

# Heart Disease Prediction (Cleveland Dataset)
## Project Overview

This project applies Machine Learning to predict heart disease using the UCI Cleveland dataset. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and classification modeling.

## Key Expertise Demonstrated

    Python & Scikit-learn: Built a classification pipeline to handle health metrics.

    Data Visualization: Used Matplotlib/Seaborn to visualize heart disease correlations with age        and cholesterol.

    Statistical Analysis: Evaluated model performance using accuracy scores and confusion matrices.
